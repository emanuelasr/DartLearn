/* types of 'Output' 
 in dart we have some ways to show a message to user;
 we can show something by using a 'print' method, and putting some data 
inside of it as the example : print('here we put some information');

but we can show a input from user inside of this 'print' too .
if we declare a variable called 'name' and take the data from user, this variable
will contain now a name or something that he wrote/type to us. to show that, we have to called this 
variable inside my print statement. for exmpl; 

var name = manel; 
print(name) -> here I have to call my variable. this output it'll be 'manel' which is the data stored inside of the variable called name. 

we have another thing that we can do too , which is mixed a little bit of text and my variable. if I want to show a message to the user 
and her name I can do that. is just I put a ' quotation mark inside of the print and then calling my variable with a dollar sign '$'
than i can show both at the same time , my question and the data inside my variable; for exmp:

  PRINT('something that i want to user see $name <- and the name of the user');
